Developing the SyncBox development process was iterative and incremental process.
During the first iteration the system blows up!
In the second iteration we solved the power problem but the were some problems with
USB3, HDMI and PIC24E crystal

To solve them we developed some extension cards (HDMI were implemented but the others were not)
These side projects my be useful as a stand-alone side products in other projects
