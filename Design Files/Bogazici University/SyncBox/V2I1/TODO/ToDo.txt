Here describe all the things which have to be improved or done in the next revision.

Schematic:
 Re design the board to move from PIC18 to dsPIC which supports multiple UART


PCB:
 from though-hole component move toward SMD packages

Production:
 support COM (Computer On Module). This way it is possible to support any type of detector driver.

Firmware:
 Rewrite the PIC program to support dsPIC24F
